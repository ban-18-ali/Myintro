<b> Introduction </b>
<pre> A paragraph is a group of sentences that focus on a single idea or topic. 
It typically begins with a topic sentence that introduces the main point, followed by supporting sentences that develop that idea with details, 
examples, or evidence. A concluding sentence may also be included to summarize or transition to the next paragraph. </pre>
